This week SymPy 1.2 was released, which included the `discrete` module. The complete changelog for the SymPy 1.2 is [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Release-Notes-for-1.2). I started the week by cleaning up `discrete` module, improving the API of public `convolution` method by attending to reviews by [Aaron](https://github.com/asmeurer) and [Kalevi](https://github.com/jksuom) and fixing issue [#14901](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/14901) reported by [Aaron](https://github.com/asmeurer) in [PR #14907](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14907).

The [PR #14907](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14907) has been merged successfully and will be part of SymPy 1.2.1.

Late this week, I started working on the convolution module for inclusion of `covering_product`.
The [PR #14298](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14928) included the same with documentation, doctests and unit tests.
The implementation of `covering_product` uses MÃ¶bius Transform with subset enumeration (`mobius_transform(..., subset=True)` and `inverse_mobius_transform(..., subset=True)`). As included in the PR, the usage for the same is:

```python
>>> from sympy import symbols, covering_product
>>> u, v, x, y, z = symbols('u v x y z')

>>> covering_product([u, v], [x, y])
[u*x, u*y + v*x + v*y]

>>> covering_product([u, v, x], [y, z])
[u*y, u*z + v*y + v*z, x*y, x*z]
```

Looking forward to the next week, where I will be implementing `intersecting_product` as the final method for the convolution module.
