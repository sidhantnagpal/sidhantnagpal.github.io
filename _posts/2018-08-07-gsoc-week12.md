The final week of Coding Period has completed.

This week, the work was mainly concerned with the documentation and refinements in the `discrete` module.
I started by opening PR [#14994](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14994) to update Sphinx docs for SymPy.
[Kalevi](https://github.com/jksuom) and [Aaron](https://github.com/asmeurer) were kind enough to review the PR and help refine it for the final merge. The documentation for `discrete` module is now part of the SymPy docs and can be referred [here](http://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/discrete.html).

Late this week, I opened PR [#15025](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/15025) for improvements in the `discrete` module.
[Colin](https://github.com/cbm755) helped fix accidental floats in unit tests (which should have been Rationals). After the review, the PR was merged successfully.

Future work would include - addition of a user-facing public method for `linrec` and making methods `fft` and `convolution_fft` efficient for both symbolic and numeric variants, as some discussion and benchmarking has been done for it and there is some work done by [Colin](https://github.com/cbm755) for `ComplexFloat` class in PR [#12192](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/12192) which would be helpful for the same.

Looking forward to the concluding phase, where I will be wrapping up GSoC and preparing the report for the final evaluation.
