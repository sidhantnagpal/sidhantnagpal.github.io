The first phase of Coding Period has concluded.

This week, I started working on the convolution for <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;2^n" title="\large 2^n" />`-group` using `fwht` - Dyadic (XOR) Convolution. The PR [#14783](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14783) dealt with this addition to the module.

I had a useful discussion with [Kalevi](https://github.com/jksuom) for clearing the API and naming convention. <br />
The `convolution` method uses `dyadic=True` as the hint which uses `convolution_fwht` for the implementation. Appropriate documentation, doctests and unit tests are also included.

Successive reviews helped in refining the PR, before the final merge later in the week.

The usage for the same is:
```python
>>> from sympy.discrete.convolutions import (convolution, convolution_fwht)
>>> from sympy import symbols
>>> u, v, x, y = symbols('u v x y')
>>> convolution([u, v], [x, y], dyadic=True)
[u*x + v*y, u*y + v*x]
>>> convolution_fwht([u, v], [x, y]) == _
True
```

Plan for this phase has executed according to the timeline, and the first evaluation has been successful.

Looking forward to the next phase of Coding Period.
