The first week of Coding Period has concluded.

I started the week working on the PR [#14712](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14712) to fix existing issues [#14262](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/14262) and [#12744](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/12744). There were some complications caused by the PR as it was affecting the `solvers` module. The failing tests on travis revealed some bugs and issues in `solvers`. The bugs are fixed, though minor issues still persist.

Late this week, I started working on the first PR [#14725](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14725) as part of my project with the aim of adding the following along with appropriate tests.
- Discrete Module
- Transforms Module
- Fast Fourier Transform (`fft`)
- Number Theoretic Transform (`ntt`)
- Fast Walsh Hadamard Transform (`fwht`)

[Kalevi](https://github.com/jksuom) brought up an important point about complicated symbolic expressions when using `fft`. [Aaron](https://github.com/asmeurer) helped me fix a minor import issue. <br>
Successive reviews helped in the following changes to PR:
- using `iterable(...)` instead of `hasattr(..., '__iter__')`
- adding doctests
- improving documentation
- fixing precision issues in `fft` using argument `dps` for decimal places or using unevaluated symbols in the first place (by passing `dps=None`)

Looking forward to another exciting week.
