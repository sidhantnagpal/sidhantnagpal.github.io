The community bonding period has concluded. As proposed, I have gone through the existing modules and have thought about various aspects of the implementation which needed to be taken care of. The discussion for the project will take place on `gitter` under `sympy/discrete`.

Discussion for API is premature but it will shape as the Coding Period commences. Meanwhile, I have control of what all needs to be done in accordance with the proposed timeline.

Being familiar with the development workflow and having contributed to SymPy, I assisted new contributors and also helped review existing PRs - [#14679](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14679), [#14698](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14698) and [#14707](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14707).

Looking forward to Coding Period.
