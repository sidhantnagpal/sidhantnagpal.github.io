The third week of Coding Period has concluded.

I started the week by finalizing the PR [#14745](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14745). The PR has been merged successfully. The master branch of `sympy` now contains transforms and convolution submodules under `discrete`. I have tested corner cases as well. Documentation and Doctests are complete for the transforms and types of convolution that are currently part of master.

Late this week, I pushed commits to [PR #14712](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14712) with the aim of fixing failing tests in `test_util.py` and `test_inequalities.py` due to `solveset`. The remaining tests are failing as `solvers` can not currently solve the transcendental equations when rewritten in exponential form.

Looking forward to next week, where I will be working on the Fast Walsh Hadamard Transform (`fwht`).
