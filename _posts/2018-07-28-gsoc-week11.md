This week, I started working on adding the final method to convolution module for Intersecting Product. PR [#14954](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14954) dealt with the addition of `intersection_product` method. Intersecting Product was implemented using MÃ¶bius Transform with superset enumeration (`mobius_transform(..., subset=False)` and `inverse_mobius_transform(..., subset=False)`). After minor documentation improvements, the PR was merged successfully. The proposed transforms and convolutions are now part of `sympy.discrete`. The basic usage for the method is:

```python
>>> from sympy import symbols, S, I, intersecting_product
>>> u, v, x, y, z = symbols('u v x y z')

>>> intersecting_product([u, v], [x, y])
[u*x + u*y + v*x, v*y]
>>> intersecting_product([u, v, x], [y, z])
[u*y + u*z + v*y + x*y + x*z, v*z, 0, 0]
```

Late this week, I started working on improving the documentation for SymPy's Sphinx docs ([http://docs.sympy.org/dev/index.html](http://docs.sympy.org/dev/index.html)) and other minor changes in the PR [#14969](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/14969). Also, issue [#14964](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/14964) was opened to discuss the possibility of using LaTeX in docstrings for SymPy documentation. The following changes were part of the PR:

- Use LaTeX for docstrings in functions.combinatorial (reference to [#14964](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/14964))
- Include genocchi and partition numbers in sphinx docs
- Improve docstrings with single and double backticks for sphinx docs
- Use plural module names under discrete (discrete.convolutions and discrete.recurrences)
- Add graphviz as a prerequisite in sympy/doc/README.rst for Debian/Ubuntu
- Fix links in references containing rounded braces and unicode chars for sphinx docs
- Miscellaneous improvements to documentation

Successive reviews and discussions were helpful in finalizing the Pull Requests.

Looking forward to the final week of Coding Period.
